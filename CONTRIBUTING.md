```

### File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `getting-started.md`
- Be descriptive: `docker-installation.md` instead of `docker.md`
- Keep names concise but clear

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Clarity First**: Write for users who may be unfamiliar with the topic
2. **Be Concise**: Get to the point quickly
3. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Include examples and code snippets
4. **Test Everything**: Verify all instructions and code examples work

### Markdown Formatting

#### Headers

Use appropriate header levels:

```markdown
# Page Title (H1) - One per page
## Main Sections (H2)
### Subsections (H3)
#### Minor Sections (H4)
```

#### Code Blocks

Always specify the language for syntax highlighting:

```markdown
\`\`\`bash
npm install notabeen
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
const notabeen = require('notabeen');
\`\`\`
```

#### Callouts

Use VitePress custom containers for important information:

```markdown
::: tip
Helpful tips and best practices
:::

::: warning
Important warnings or caveats
:::

::: danger
Critical information that could cause issues
:::

::: info
Additional context or explanations
:::
```

#### Links

- Use relative links for internal pages: `[Installation](/guide/getting-started/installation)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links: `[VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/)`

#### Images

- Store images in `docs/public/images/`
- Use descriptive filenames
- Always include alt text

```markdown
![Notabeen Dashboard](../public/images/dashboard.png)
```

### Writing Style

#### Voice and Tone

- **Use second person**: "You can install Notabeen..." (not "One can install...")
- **Be conversational**: Write as if explaining to a colleague
- **Be encouraging**: "Great job! You've successfully installed Notabeen."
- **Avoid jargon**: Explain technical terms when first used

#### Grammar and Punctuation

- Use American English spelling
- Use the Oxford comma: "apples, oranges, and bananas"
- Keep sentences concise (aim for 20-25 words)
- Use active voice: "Run the command" (not "The command should be run")

#### Code Examples

- Test all code examples before submitting
- Include necessary context (imports, setup, etc.)
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Show expected output when relevant

```javascript
// Good example with context
import { NotabeenClient } from 'notabeen';

// Initialize the client with your API key
const client = new NotabeenClient({
  apiKey: process.env.NOTABEEN_API_KEY
});

// Fetch email summaries
const summaries = await client.getSummaries();
console.log(summaries);
// Expected output: [{ id: '1', summary: '...' }, ...]
```
